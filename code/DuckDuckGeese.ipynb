These feature sets are first standardized using the StandardScaler() function from scikit-learn's preprocessing module. Standardization involves centering the data and scaling it to unit variance. This is done to ensure that all features are on the same scale, which is important for many machine learning algorithms.\n\n\n---\n\n\nNext, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the standardized data using the PCA() function from scikit-learn's decomposition module. PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the original feature space into a new space of lower dimensionality. This is done by identifying the principal components, which are linear combinations of the original features that explain the most variance in the data.\n\n---\n\nThe n_components parameter specifies the number of principal components to keep. In this case, it is set to 5. Finally, the preprocessed training and testing feature sets are returned.\n\n---\n\nOverall, this data preprocessing pipeline can help improve the performance of machine learning models on the cricket dataset by reducing the dimensionality of the feature space and scaling the data to a common range.","metadata":{"id":"HI6wOdxKFw0b"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\ndef preprocess_data(train_x, test_x, n_components=5):\n    # Scale the data\n    scaler = StandardScaler()\n    train_x = scaler.fit_transform(train_x)\n    test_x = scaler.transform(test_x)\n\n    # Apply PCA\n    pca = PCA(n_components=n_components)\n    train_x = pca.fit_transform(train_x)\n    test_x = pca.transform(test_x)\n\n    return train_x, test_x\n","metadata":{"colab":{"background_save":true},"id":"fb6aeef3","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-11T17:27:44.865449Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-11T17:27:44.865861Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-11T17:27:44.873548Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-11T17:27:44.865822Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-11T17:27:44.872232Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":" # Preprocess data using PCA\ntrain_x, test_x = preprocess_data(train_x, test_x, n_components=5)","metadata":{"colab":{"background_save":true},"id":"705397c8","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-11T17:27:44.875269Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-11T17:27:44.875836Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-11T17:27:44.916283Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-11T17:27:44.875801Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-11T17:27:44.915041Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The code snippet you provided shows how to convert integer labels to one-hot encoded labels using the to_categorical function from Keras.\n\n\n---\n\n\nOne-hot encoding is a technique used to represent categorical variables as binary vectors.

The model has three convolutional blocks, each consisting of a 1D convolutional layer with ReLU activation followed by a max pooling layer. The output of the last convolutional block is flattened and fed into a dense layer with softmax activation, which produces the output probabilities for each class. The model is compiled with Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. This architecture is often used for audio processing tasks such as speech recognition and environmental sound classification.","metadata":{"id":"n8oDj_gFGa6a"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from

model architecture in the code you provided is a variant of the CIF (Convolutional-Inception-FullyConnected) model, which combines convolutional and fully connected layers to achieve high performance in image classification tasks.\n\n\n---\n\nThis is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that has three convolutional blocks, followed by a GlobalAveragePooling1D layer and a dense output layer with a sigmoid activation function. It has been trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function, and evaluated on a test set using accuracy as the evaluation metric.\n\nThe model architecture is suitable for a 1D Convolutional model to classify time-series data. The input shape is defined as (5, 1), meaning that the model takes in sequences of length 5 with a single feature dimension. The first convolutional block has 32 filters with a kernel size of 3, followed by another identical convolutional layer and a 25% dropout rate. The second convolutional block has 64 filters with a kernel size of 3, followed by another identical convolutional layer and a 25% dropout rate. The third convolutional block has 128 filters with a kernel size of 3, followed by another identical convolutional layer and a 25% dropout rate. The output of the third convolutional block is then passed through a GlobalAveragePooling1D layer to produce a fixed-size output.

classification tasks. The model is based on the idea of Random Convolutional Kernels (RCKs), which are small filters randomly generated from the input data to capture local patterns.\n\nThe Rocket model consists of five convolutional blocks, each with a different number of filters and kernel size, and a final dense layer for classification. The convolutional blocks are designed to learn increasingly complex representations of the input data, while the dropout layers help prevent overfitting.\n\nThe model uses batch normalization to normalize the activations between layers and to speed up the training process. Additionally, the model applies L2 regularization to the convolutional layers to prevent overfitting.\n\nOverall, the Rocket model is a simple, yet effective architecture for time series classification tasks, and it has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. Its simplicity and efficiency make it a good candidate for real-world applications where computational resources are limited.","metadata":{"id":"biCpsUMFq58Y"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from
